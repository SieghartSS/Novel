    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <div class="novel-content">
      <p>Inside the quarantine facility, a boy stood with a nervous expression. There was something unsettling about him—an eerie aura, as if the same hollow presence lingered within him. He stayed silent until a hand gently rested on his shoulder from behind.</p>

      <p>“Are you okay, Laine?”</p>

      <p>Laine shifted and gazed at the woman who stood beside him. The woman as a sharp feature with smooth delicate surface. She has a long black hair that’s reach her back, the most striking about her though were her eyes with sharp blue color that seemed to pierce anything it looked. That woman was aunt Serena, she was a healer that worked at nearby medical center and have been taking care of him ever since his parents died.  </p>

      <p>His tense face must have betrayed his emotions, because concern immediately appeared in her expression.</p>

      <p>“I’ll be fine,” Laine murmured. “Just… a little nervous.”</p>

      <p>Serena sighed softly, her lips curling into a reassuring smile. “Don’t be nervous. Besides, didn’t your pretty aunt turn out just fine?” She gave a small laugh, trying to lighten the mood.</p>

      <p>Laine let out a chuckle, though brief, before a firm voice called from behind.</p>

      <p>“Candidate Laine, are you ready?”</p>

      <p>Laine turned around to meet the voice, his gaze stoped at the man beside him. The man is tall and has an imposing build, his broad shoulders and athletic pyshique shown that he’s a powerful awakened with combat abillites. His gaze is sharp like all seasoned fighter does, he has a sharp feature with short black hair combed to the side.</p>

      <p><i>I wonder what ability I’ll awaken with…</i></p>

      <p>“Yes, sir.” Laine bowed slightly to Serena. “Thank you for seeing me off, Aunt.”</p>

      <p>She waved dismissively, though her smile remained warm. “It’s nothing. Good luck with your awakening, Laine.”</p>

      <p>Laine nodded once more and followed the man.</p>

      <div class="separator">***</div>

      <p>They moved from room to room as attendants checked his height, weight, and physique. Eventually, they descended a staircase that led to a sealed chamber.</p>

      <p>The room was small, furnished only with a white bed and a chair. A two-way mirror stretched across one wall, a camera watched from the ceiling, and a red button sat mounted beside the glass. The metal walls gleamed faintly, built sturdy enough to contain any awakened who might lose control and turn hollow.</p>

      <p>“Wait here for a while. Someone else will be monitoring you,” the officer instructed before leaving.</p>

      <p>Laine sat on the bed, motionless. Minutes passed in silence, until the sound of a door opening pulled his attention.</p>

      <p>A woman stepped in. Her black hair brushed her shoulders, her posture confident, and her cold green eyes made her presence sharp, unapproachable.</p>

      <p>“Ahem. Candidate Laine, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>Caught staring, Laine only managed a stiff nod.</p>

      <p>“My name is Cecily,” she said. “I’m here to guide candidates through the awakening process. My abilities are meant to assist you.”</p>
